# **FORMATIVE ASSIGNMENT: ADVANCED LINEAR ALGEBRA (PCA)**

## **Overview**
This assignment focuses on applying advanced linear algebra concepts, specifically eigenvalues and eigenvectors, along with multivariate probability topics under covariance. You will implement **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset while preserving as much variance as possible. PCA helps extract relevant information by identifying principal components that explain relationships between features in the data.

## **Instructions**
- Complete the provided **Google Colab notebook template**.
- Instructions are marked with a **"TO DO"** comment within the notebook.
- Fill in the missing code or responses where indicated.

### **Goals of PCA**
The **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** algorithm aims to:
1. **Reduce the number of features** in a dataset by transforming it into a lower-dimensional space.
2. **Retain as much information (variance) as possible**.
3. Calculate covariance, perform eigendecomposition, and project data onto principal components.

## **Tasks**
### **Task 1: Implement PCA from Scratch**
- Compute **covariance matrix**.
- Calculate **eigenvalues and eigenvectors**.
- Project the dataset onto the **principal components**.

### **Task 2: Dynamic Selection of Principal Components**
- Dynamically determine the **number of principal components** based on explained variance.

### **Task 3: Optimization**
- Optimize PCA implementation for **performance**.
- Handle **large datasets** efficiently.

## **Data**
- Replace the example data with the **fuel_econ.csv** dataset provided in the link.
- Compute the **principal components** using your PCA implementation.

### **Important Notes**
- Ensure that the output for each code cell (plots, data, results) is **visible** in the notebook.
- Submit a **GitHub repository link** containing the completed notebook.

## **Part 2: Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors**
### **Tasks**
- Find the **second (λ2) and third (λ3) eigenvalues** and their corresponding eigenvectors for the given matrix.
